I am a PhD student at Team CX, Australian Centre for Ecogenomics (ACE), School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences (SCMB), the University of Queensland (UQ). https://cxchan.com/team/ 

This contains my work from 
- Undergraduate research project on developing mahcine learning pipeline (Variational Autoencoder) to identify locations of RNA modification (Epitranscriptome) of Effrenium voratum (dinoflagellate in the family Symbiodiniaceae)
- Honours research project on investigating genomic variation of Symbiodiniaceae community and Endozoicomonas of Acropora tenuis and A. hyacinthus across the GBR
- PhD project on characterising genomic variation of microbial symbionts in Acropora tenuis and A. hyacinthus across the GBR
